## Project Description

Title: MTPLAY
Description: MTPLAY is a New York City trivia game. The player receives a question 
that can pertain to the history of the city, a fun fact, or anything
in between. 

There are seven question in total, but if you get more than TWO wrong, 
YOU'RE OUT and must start from the top. 

Have fun!

## Game Components

### Landing Page
The landing page consists of the title of the game plus a game description.


### Game Initialization
The background will be a NYC themed backdrop, and each trivia question will be a smaller window within the broswer.

### Playing The Game
Each question is harder than the last. If you can keep a winning streak, you win! If you get more than two wrong, you lose!

### Winning The Game
If you answer every question correctly you win and you have the option to play again.

### Game Reset
If you win or lose you go back to the landing page.

## MVP 

Each question will be multiple choice. Some questions will be very simple, some will be difficult. 
The question will be displayed as a smaller window within the broswer.

## POST MVP

Music, and a timer.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |
| Total |  | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
